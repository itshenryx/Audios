# What is Audios?
Audios is a fully functional Audiobook store created by me.
<br>
It uses php and mySql for its backend and HTML/CSS/Javascript for its frontend.
<br>
Demo : https://audioos.000webhostapp.com/home.php , <i>Best viewed on Google Chrome and on a 1920x1080 display.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b><!>000Webhost's free service does not support audio/video streaming and this is why the audio files donâ€™t play on the website. </b>
